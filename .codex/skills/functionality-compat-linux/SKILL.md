description: Port ScreenToGif behavior from Windows/WPF to the Avalonia Linux application while preserving complete user workflows and Linux platform contracts. Use for functionality parity and workflow implementation; use layout-compat-linux instead when the work is only visual geometry or styling parity.

# Linux functionality compatibility

Preserve the Windows user contract rather than copying Windows/WPF implementation details. For editor work, extend the existing normalized-PNG model and keep commands complete at the user boundary: define selection rules, validate parameters, preserve work on cancellation or failure, refresh timeline/preview/status state, and include the mutation in shared history when it changes frames, order, or timing.

Capture products, Windows `.stg` compatibility, and a general vector-annotation canvas require foundations beyond an isolated editor command. Do not approximate such a dependency inside the caller; when it is outside the current task, keep the control unavailable and identify the missing subsystem instead of leaving it accidentally inert.

Read only the references needed for the active surface:

- First-time component parity or an unclear Windows behavior: [references/porting-workflow.md](references/porting-workflow.md)
- Options, settings persistence, autostart, tray behavior, or application startup/lifetime: [references/options.md](references/options.md)
- Any command that mutates frames, order, timing, selection, or project state: [references/editor-session.md](references/editor-session.md)
- Image transforms or their reusable FFmpeg/history foundation: [references/image.md](references/image.md)
- Fade or directional Slide generation: [references/transitions.md](references/transitions.md)
- Home selection, clipboard, zoom, and action history: [references/home.md](references/home.md)
- Edit sequence and timing operations: [references/edit.md](references/edit.md)

- Playback navigation and timing: [references/playback.md](references/playback.md)
- Statistics and live-state projection: [references/statistics.md](references/statistics.md)

References are added as tab implementations earn decision-changing knowledge. A missing reference means there is not yet banked tab-specific guidance; inspect the current implementation and tests rather than inventing a rule.
